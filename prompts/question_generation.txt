Generate exactly {num_questions} open-ended comprehension questions that:
1. Are NOT multiple choice or yes/no questions
2. Start with "Why" or "How" to encourage critical thinking
3. Require {min_words}-{max_words} word thoughtful answers
4. Test understanding beyond simple recall
5. Are appropriate for {age_range} year old children
6. Focus on themes, character motivation, cause-and-effect, or inference

For each question, provide 3-5 expected keywords that would appear in a good answer.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks):
{{
  "questions": [
    {{
      "text": "Why did [character/event]...",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
      "difficulty": "medium"
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Questions must be open-ended, not yes/no
- Use "Why" and "How" question stems
- Focus on comprehension, not just recall
- Keep questions age-appropriate
- Provide relevant keywords for answer validation
